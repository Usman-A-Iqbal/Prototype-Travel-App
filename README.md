# Prototype-Travel-App
Developed a TUI-based travel application prototype in Java, employing a comprehensive range of data structures and time-efficient algorithms.

Developed a custom Weighted Graph Abstract Data Type (ADT) to model travel locations and implemented a range of algorithms including Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to solve optimisation problems, such as finding the shortest, most cost-effective path between a list of destination cities, and an all-pairs shortest path problem.

Utilised defensive programming techniques, object-oriented analysis and design principles, UML diagrams, and thorough Javadoc documentation. This multifaceted approach resulted in a robust, well-documented, and efficient application, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills and technical proficiency.
